This article reviews established methods of quantifying shape in ship and boat archaeology—linear measurement ratios and form coefficients—and evaluates the utility of 3D geometric morphometrics (GM). The 3D shape of 30 vessels from north-west Europe dating between 325 BC and AD 1915 are quantified to study how hull shape relates to a vessel’s function and intended operating environment. A comparison of the three methods highlights the importance of analysing the complexity of a hull in a holistic manner and demonstrates that 3D GM outperforms the traditional methods. © 2020 The Authors.

The ancestors of the Inuit were the first to introduce the widespread usage of dog sledge transportation technology to the Americas, but whether the Inuit adopted local Palaeo-Inuit dogs or introduced a new dog population to the region remains unknown. To test these hypotheses, we generated mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometric data of skull and dental elements from a total of 922 North American Arctic dogs and wolves spanning over 4500 years. Our analyses revealed that dogs from Inuit sites dating from2000 BP possess morphological and genetic signatures that distinguish them from earlier Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and identified a novel mitochondrial clade in eastern Siberia and Alaska. The genetic legacy of these Inuit dogs survives today in modern Arctic sledge dogs despite phenotypic differences between archaeological and modern Arctic dogs. Together, our data reveal that Inuit dogs derive from a secondary pre-contact migration of dogs distinct from Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and probably aided the Inuit expansion across the North American Arctic beginning around 1000 BP. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This type of artefact was used to ignite the powder of firearms through a flintlock mechanism from the middle-seventeenth to the early-twentieth century in different contexts around the world. Taking what is a novel and exploratory approach in historical archaeology, this paper offers a quantitative analysis of a random sample of 200 unused gunflints recovered from the British shipwreck Deltebre I. This cargo ship belonged to an allied convoy that unsuccessfully tried to liberate Tarragona city from the Napoleonic forces, and sunk in the Ebro river delta, Catalonia, Spain, in 1813. The results from size and shape characterisation of the unused gunflints using geometric morphometric methods are presented. In order to assess morphometric variation between used and unused artefacts, this sample was compared with published images of 22 used British gunflints from different archaeological contexts. Finally, the usefulness of applied methodology to quantitatively characterise the design and morphometric variations of this kind of artefacts is highlighted. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Studies of North African fossil microvertebrates have increased considerably in recent years, but they no longer just provide palaeontological descriptions of the species found in the assemblages. They also aim at better understanding the evolution of faunal communities in relation to Quaternary climate changes and at reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental background of prehistoric human occupations, in well-established taphonomic and chronological contexts. These studies are also increasingly adopting an integrative approach by combining archaeology, palaeontology, (palaeo)genetics, taphonomy, palaeoecology and systematics, and using new methods such as geometric morphometrics and isotopic analyses on both fossil and modern specimens. This paper aims to present a history of the studies on Quaternary terrestrial microvertebrates from northwestern Africa, and show how recent multidisciplinary studies have provided new perspectives and evidence on the respective influences of climate change and increasing human pressure on their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Herpetofauna; Integrative approach; Maghreb; Micromammals DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.5 (Natahi et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Natahi, S., Coquerelle, M., Pereira, G., Bayle, P. 57210429853;36140239700;36192143700;35434353800; Neurocranial shape variation among Tarascan populations: Evidence for varying degrees in artificially modified crania in pre-Hispanic West Mexico (1200–1400 AD) (2019) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 170 (3), pp. 418-432. https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070705630&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajpa.23917&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9848cacbc1a4f7470334281e873f0428 DOI: 10.1002/ajpa.23917 AFFILIATIONS: Université de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, UMR 5199 PACEA, Pessac, France; Department of Medicine and Surgery (Stomatology Area), Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Alcorcón, Spain; UMR 8096, Archéologie des Amériques, CNRS, Maison René-Ginouvès, Nanterre, France ABSTRACT: Introduction: Along the Mesoamerican western margin, the Zacapu basin has yielded a large number of human remains demonstrating usage of artificial cranial modification (ACM). However, at the onset of the Middle Postclassic (1200–1400 AD) only few individuals still exhibit clear signs of ACM. Some authors have suggested that, rather than disappearing entirely, ACM may have become less visible anatomically, making it difficult to identify based on simple visual analyses. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometric methods to investigate the extent to which ACM persisted during the Postclassic in this region. Materials and methods: We measured the 3D vault’s shape changes in a sample of surface-scanned human crania: 55 individuals from the Postclassic Zacapu basin and a control group of 31 individuals from a Huichol Mexican Indian sample and a French medieval series from La Granède. We used a principal component analysis to explore the shape variation within the sample and employed the neighbor joining method to identify morphological groups. Finally, we quantified each individual’s asymmetry. Results: We identified three groups displaying shape features diverging from those of the control group. The first group is characterized by marked fronto-obelionic ACM, whereas the other two show mild forms of ACM. The individuals in all three groups display moderate to high degrees of asymmetry compared to the control group. Discussion: The marked fronto-obelionic modification is clear evidence of a specific ACM technique. The two types of mild ACM most likely result from different techniques but their moderate degree of modification brings into question the intentions behind their production. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The history of bere on these islands is long and, in an era of diminishing landrace cultivation, bere now represents one of the oldest cereal landraces in Europe still grown commercially. The longevity of bere raises the possibility of using grain characteristics of present-day specimens to identify bere in the archaeological record. Geometric modern morphometric (GMM) analysis of grains from bere and other barley landraces is conducted to determine whether landraces can be differentiated on grain morphology. Results indicate that there are morphological differences between bere and other British and Scandinavian landraces, and between bere from Orkney and the Western Isles, both of which are apparent in genetic analysis. This finding paves the way for the identification of bere archaeologically, helping to establish its status as living heritage and securing its commercial future. More broadly, this work indicates the potential of grain GMM for the recognition of cereal landraces, permitting the ancestry and exchange of landraces to be traced in the archaeological record. © 2018, The Author(s).

The lower archaeological levels of BK are characterized by anthropogenic activity related to the exploitation of megafauna (elephant, hippopotamus, Sivatherium) and smaller game (zebra, wildebeest and antelopes). These remains display a high frequency of cut marks. The exceptional state of preservation of the BK fossil assemblage has allowed a wide range of different analyses that, among other things, detected the use of quartzite in butchering activities through the study of cut marks. Following up previous analyses, this paper presents the study of a series of cut marks from the BK faunal assemblage using a 3D geometric morphometric methodological approach in order to determine the mineralogical properties of the quartzite used at the site. BK cut marks are compared with experimentally produced cut marks using 9 mineralogically different quartzite types from Olduvai Gorge. This comparative analysis provides valuable hints about the exact nature of the raw materials used in butchering activities. The results presented here identify a preferential use of quartzite with a finer granular composition, suggesting that hominin populations were already selecting the best raw materials for their use in specific activities 1.3 Mya. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cut mark morphology; Experimental archaeology; Homo erectus; Olduvai gorge; Quartzite; Taphonomy DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.8 (Pelletier 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Pelletier, M. 56677378300; Morphological diversity of wild rabbit populations: Implications for archaeology and palaeontology (2019) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 128 (1), art. no. blz074, pp. 211-224.

However, the variability of these characteristics is still both poorly understood and under-documented due to a lack of population-level data that are essential for reliably interpreting the fossil record of this species. Here we address the morphometric diversity of wild rabbits in seven current populations from south-western Europe. Size variations in different skeletal parts were analysed to explore the potential impact of sexual dimorphism. A geometric morphometric analysis of the third lower premolar (p3) - a tooth commonly used to distinguish leporid species - was used to evaluate the relative effects of size, phylogeny, geographical location and climate on shape variation. The results show a negligible impact of sexual dimorphism, contradicting previous studies. We also demonstrate geography and climate to be the main factors driving variation in p3 shape, potentially calling into question criteria typically used to identify rabbit species. These results are valuable not only for palaeobiologists studying the taxonomy and the evolutionary history of the leporid family but also for archaeologists interested in the socio-economic and behavioural aspects of Palaeolithic human groups. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

The shape of the external basicranial portion of the temporal bone, in particular, has been found to have one of the strongest phylogenetic signals in the crania, and so it can be effectively used to distinguish between populations on a large, often global scale. However, its applicability to the analysis of relatively closely-related groups remains largely unexplored. The retention of population signatures in the shape of this portion of the temporal bone is particularly useful for archaeology, as the fragility of the cranium makes analysis of its shape in entirety often difficult. If the shape of the temporal bone can identify differences between relatively closely-related populations with a similar accuracy as for more distantly-related populations, this would significantly aid analyses of population history on a local scale. To test this, we initiated a study that used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to investigate the shape variation of the temporal bone of two British archaeological populations that were separated both temporally and geographically. The results of a MANOVA found statistically significant shape differences between the two populations and a DFA found that the shape of the temporal bone can correctly classify 84.7% of individuals into their respective population. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that the shape of the temporal bone can accurately identify differences between two relatively closely-related populations. Future research should focus on examining larger samples from a greater number of populations to determine whether this pattern is widespread. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cranial shape; Human variation; Identification; Portmahomack; Poundbury; Relatedness; Shape analyses DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.10 (Haruda et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Haruda, A.F., Varfolomeev, V., Goriachev, A., Yermolayeva, A., Outram, A.K. 57192678397;36992540600;57208694507;57208683323;8954776500; A new zooarchaeological application for geometric morphometric methods: Distinguishing Ovis aries morphotypes to address connectivity and mobility of prehistoric Central Asian pastoralists (2019) Journal of Archaeological Science, 107, pp. 50-57.

However, there has been limited utilization of these methods to discriminate between populations of the same taxa to challenge and refine other key archaeological issues, such as migration and connectivity in prehistory. Presented here is a novel application of a three-dimensional landmark based geometric morphometric approach to address the nature of long distance trade and connectivity on the prehistoric Silk Road. The similarity of Bronze and Iron Age archaeological cultures along this steppe route has encouraged characterisations of these people as nomads, with highly mobile, integrated, and connected human and animal populations. However, the interconnectedness of domestic animal populations, in particular sheep (Ovis aries), the foundation of this prehistoric pastoral economy, has never been examined. This study utilized geometric morphometric methods to quantify geometric morphometric variance of O. aries astragali between three geographically disparate settlement sites within a single Final Bronze age cultural and chronological context. Significant differences between morphotypes revealed that protracted mobility patterns were unlikely and that while animal exchange may have occurred, it was not pervasive enough to produce a uniform sheep morphotype across central and southeastern Kazakhstan. The result of this new application of geometric morphometric methods challenges models of uniform and undifferentiated long distance mobility and economic connectivity between the peoples of the Silk Road. © 2019 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Bronze age; Central Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Ovis aries; Pastoralism; Three-dimensional digitisation; Zooarchaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.11 (Yravedra Sainz de los Terreros, Maté-González, and Courtenay 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Yravedra Sainz de los Terreros, J., Maté-González, M.Á., Courtenay, L.A. 57209685315;56780291300;57200549280; New technologies applied to archaeology.

The use of multivariate statistics and the most recent advances in microscopic analysis of Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) have enable a less subjective interpretation of site formation processes. Nevertheless, this broader range of methodological approaches also presents some problems. The capacity of laser scanners in processing inconspicuous and superficial cortical alterations, such as trampling marks, has proven to be problematic. This study presents a new advance towards resolving this problem through the use of the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, whereby detailed digital three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are able to pick up such minute BSMs. Through the statistical comparison of the David Laser scanner and the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, this paper contributes to our understanding of said equipment, followed by a significant advance in the characterisation of superficial BSMs. The combination of advanced microscopy and the application of geometric morphometrics highlights a morphological differentiation between two different types of trampling marks, hereby named scratch and graze trampling marks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Bone surface modifications (BSM); Geometric morphometrics; Microscopy; Taphonomy DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.13 (Linares-Matás et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Linares-Matás, G.J., Yravedra, J., Maté-González, M.Á., Courtenay, L.A., Aramendi, J., Cuartero, F., González-Aguilera, D. 57202464782;56962776200;56780291300;57200549280;55827562600;36476024800;24477009700; A geometric-morphometric assessment of three-dimensional models of experimental cut-marks using flint and quartzite flakes and handaxes (2019) Quaternary International, 517, pp. 45-54.

Identification of micro-morphological variability between different taphonomical alterations on ancient bone allows detection and comparison of bone-surface modifications and associated taphonomical agents and activities. By taking a geometrical-morphometrical approach, data from 3-D laser-scanning and micro-photogrammetrical models of experimental cut-marks enable statistical analysis to classify and distinguish between cut-marks by bifaces from those by flakes, and, in each case, between marks made by flint from those made by quartzite tools. Analysis of two tool types, each made from two raw materials as independent variables, is a methodological advance in morphometrical studies of experimental cut-marks, which hitherto have tended to focus on the respective parts played by tool types or types of raw material in morphometrical characterization of experimental and archaeological cut-marks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; High-resolution taphonomy; Multivariate statistics; Palaeolithic technology; Raw materials DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.14 (Lloyd A.

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits. GMM studies have produced promising results, however methodological limitations are still present. This paper presents the first combined application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and GMM to the analysis of carnivore tooth marks, generating classification rates of 100% between carnivore species in some cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and methods: The sample comprises 76 adult skulls from five archaeological sites, ranging from 4,500 to 1,530 BP. 3D geometric morphometrics, multivariate statistics, quantitative evolutionary genetic and biodistance analyses were performed to study the diachronic variation in craniofacial morphology. Analyses were performed on two cranial modules: the face and the cranial vault, across three major diachronic groups representing the late Neolithic (LNA), the Bronze Age (BA), and the Han-Jin dynasty (HD). Results: Average regional FST for both cranial modules was low, indicating relatively greater variation within diachronic groups than among them. While the LNA and BA groups did not show any significant differences in facial and vault shape, significant craniofacial shape changes were detected between the BA and HD groups. Discussion: The consistent craniofacial morphology during the LNA and the BA, and the shift in morphology between the BA and the HD indicates that cultural discontinuity does not always coincide with biological discontinuity. The Hehuang population evolved in situ with few changes, despite cultural and dietary changes, until the HD when migrations from the Central Plains are associated with extra-local gene flow to the area. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BP. Ichnological data enable us to shed light on individual and group level behavior, social relationship, and mode of exploration of the uneven terrain. Five individuals, two adults, an adolescent and two children, entered the cave barefoot and illuminated the way with a bunch of wooden sticks. Traces of crawling locomotion are documented for the first time in the global human ichnological record. Anatomical details recognizable in the crawling traces show that no clothing was present between limbs and the trampled sediments. Our study demonstrates that very young children (the youngest about 3 years old) were active members of the Upper Palaeolithic populations, even in apparently dangerous and social activities. © Romano et al.

Micro-morphological differences can be detected in multiple different taphonomic alterations on bone cortical surfaces that can later be used to compare different trace mark types. Through this, we can generate studies that are able to diagnose the specific taphonomic agents and activities that produce said traces that can be found on osteological surfaces. This paper presents experimental data that have been studied using micro-photogrammetry and geometric morphometrics, successfully distinguishing morphological differences in cut marks produced by different lithic tool types as well as different raw materials. The statistical results and methodologies presented here can later be applied to archaeological sites; aiding in our understanding of raw material exploitation, tool production as well as the different butchering activities that are present in faunal assemblages. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies. © 2017 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Evolutionary Archaeology; Geometric Morphometrics; Interdisciplinarity; Stone tools DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.19 (Thulman 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Thulman, D.K. 33768076600; A Typology of Florida Fluted Points Using Landmark-based Geometric Morphometrics (2019) PaleoAmerica, .

Three highly distinctive types were discriminated using the shapes of the point bases. LGM is a powerful method for discriminating shapes, so paying close attention to analytical details is crucial for meaningful analyses. In archaeology, LGM is in its relative infancy compared to its use in biology, and archaeologists have not settled on standard procedures for its use in artifact shape analysis. Several general issues in the use of LGM for artifact-shape discrimination are discussed and illustrated, especially the effects of sample size and the Pinocchio Effect, in which highly variable aspects of an artifact shape, such as the fluted point blade, can affect analyses in unintended ways. The choices made in creating this typology are discussed in detail and alternatives tested to show how choices can significantly change results and archaeological interpretations. © 2019, © 2019 Center for the Study of the First Americans.

This study is focused upon an analysis of Caddo bottle shapes for Belcher Engraved, Hickory Fine Engraved, Keno Trailed, Smithport Plain, and Taylor Engraved vessels from the Allen Plantation, Belcher Mound, Gahagan Mound, and Smithport Landing sites in the Clarence H. Webb collections from northwest Louisiana. Results indicate some significant relationships between bottle shape and size (allometry), bottle shape and type, and bottle shape and site. A test of morphological integration indicates that the bottles are significantly integrated, meaning that those discrete traits used to characterise their shape (rim, neck, body, and base) vary in a coordinated manner, highlighting significant integration between suites of attributes. The Smithport Plain and Hickory (Fine) Engraved bottles found at the Belcher Mound, Smithport Landing, and Gahagan Mound sites also provide evidence for two discrete (north–south) base and body shapes. © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D; American Southeast; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological disparity; Morphological integration; Virtual archaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final ACCESS TYPE: Open Access SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.21 (O’Higgins, Fitton, and Godinho 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 O’Higgins, P., Fitton, L.C., Godinho, R.M. 7004722122;36738982500;56996996100; Geometric morphometrics and finite elements analysis: Assessing the functional implications of differences in craniofacial form in the hominin fossil record (2019) Journal of Archaeological Science, 101, pp. 159-168.

In parallel, increasing numbers of studies have applied finite elements analysis (FEA) to the study of skeletal mechanics in fossil and extant hominoid material. While FEA studies of fossils are becoming ever more popular they are constrained by the difficulties of reconstruction and by the uncertainty that inevitably attaches to the estimation of forces and material properties. Adding to these modelling difficulties it is still unclear how FEA analyses should best deal with species variation. Comparative studies of skeletal form and function can be further advanced by applying tools from the GM toolkit to the inputs and outputs of FEA studies. First they facilitate virtual reconstruction of damaged material and can be used to rapidly create 3D models of skeletal structures. Second, GM methods allow variation to be accounted for in FEA by warping models to represent mean and extreme forms of interest. Third, GM methods can be applied to compare FEA outputs – the ways in which skeletal elements deform when loaded. Model comparisons are hampered by differences in material properties, forces and size among models but how deformations from FEA are impacted by these parameters is increasingly well understood, allowing them to be taken into account in comparing FEA outputs. In this paper we review recent advances in the application of GM in relation to FEA studies of craniofacial form in hominins, providing examples from our recent work and a critical appraisal of the state of the art. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Craniofacial form; Finite element analysis; Form-function; Functional performance; Geometric morphometrics DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.22 (Buchanan, Collard, and O’Brien 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Buchanan, B., Collard, M., O’Brien, M.J. 11241802300;7102608373;36128081000; Geometric Morphometric Analyses Support Incorporating the Goshen Point Type into Plainview (2019) American Antiquity, 85 (1), pp. 171-181. https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077302252&amp;doi=10.1017%2faaq.2019.89&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ee3e1dd8c53be99abb513994a835b3c6 DOI: 10.1017/aaq.2019.89 AFFILIATIONS: Department of Anthropology, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, OK 74104, United States; Department of Archaeology, Simon Fraser University, Burnaby, British Columbia V5A 1S6, Canada; Department of History, Texas AandM University-San Antonio, San Antonio, TX 78224, United States ABSTRACT: Recent work has demonstrated that Goshen points overlap in time with another group of unfluted lanceolate points from the Plains, Plainview points. This has raised the question of whether the two types should be kept separate or consolidated into a single type. We sought to resolve this issue by applying geometric morphometric methods to a sample of points from well-documented Goshen and Plainview assemblages. We found that their shapes were statistically indistinguishable, which indicates that Goshen and Plainview points should be assigned to the same type. Because Plainview points were recognized before Goshen points, it is the latter type name that should be dropped. Sinking Goshen into Plainview allows us to move beyond taxonomic issues and toward understanding both the spatiotemporal variation that exists among Plainview assemblages and what it can tell us about the adaptations and social dynamics of Plainview groups.

However, its impact on craniofacial variation and on the perceived differences among populations is unclear. The maxillomandibular relationship, which alters masticatory force direction, is a factor often neglected but it can contribute to variation in craniofacial morphology, particularly among modern/urban populations where the prevalence of dental malocclusions is greater than in prehistoric populations. This study investigates the influence of masticatory load intensity and maxillomandibular relationship as a proxy for force direction on the human craniofacial skeleton. By using 3D imaging and geometric morphometrics, we analyzed craniofacial shape variation among 186 individuals from pre-Hispanic and modern Chilean and Argentinean populations that differ in diet consistency (a proxy for masticatory load intensity) and maxillomandibular relationship. We predicted that masticatory load would have a subtle effect on the upper craniofacial bones and that this would be more marked in the maxilla. Our results showed no clear influence of masticatory load on craniofacial shape, particularly in modern/urban populations. Allometry, on the contrary, shows a stronger effect. The degree of integration between the upper craniofacial bones and the load-bearing maxilla depends on masticatory load intensity, decreasing from high to low but showing a conservative pattern of covariation among the groups. The degree of variation in the shape of the maxilla is greater than the upper craniofacial bones. These results suggest that masticatory load has a limited effect in determining differences in craniofacial morphology among populations. This effect is slightly greater for the maxillary region of the face. We propose that the reduction of functional constraints is key to greater shape variation found in modern/urban populations. © 2019 Eyquem et al.

B18, Allée Geoffroy Saint Hilaire, Pessac Cedex, CS, 50023, 33615, France ABSTRACT: The manufacture of composite projectile technology requires the production and assemblage of tightly fitted parts designed to fulfill a number of distinct functions. Each part combines a number of techno-functional units, and various processes may be responsible for the shape variability of these units. In order to investigate the relative contribution of each process to the overall variability of a projectile implement, one must identify the point of demarcation between its techno-functional units. In the present paper, the concept of shape modularity is introduced to precisely identify this locus. The application of geometric morphometrics and shape modularity to the study of two Aurignacian osseous projectile point types, i.e., split- and massive-based points, reveals interesting patterns. On both types, the maximum width delimits the distal and proximal techno-functional units of these objects. When focusing on the morphometric variability and the geographic distribution of the implements’ proximal unit, the eight shapes identified for split-based points are found over vast regions of Europe. On the other hand, the two proximal shapes defined for massive-based points show a pattern of local, or regional, aggregation. These proximal shapes were likely considered fit for hafting and hunting by the prehistoric populations who reproduced them, and they are interpreted as a proxy for the socially shared rules of production that guided the manufacture of these tool types. They could therefore be used in future studies that aim to identify group membership amongst the Aurignacian metapopulation and the extent of their interactions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Bone technology; Early Upper Palaeolithic; Europe; Projectile points; Shape modularity DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.25 (MacLeod 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 MacLeod, N. 57200347364; The quantitative assessment of archaeological artifact groups: Beyond geometric morphometrics (2018) Quaternary Science Reviews, 201, pp. 319-348.

Morphometric methods have played an increasingly large role in such quantitative assessments. However, standard approaches to morphometric analyses are often poorly suited to many artifact types as much variation of interest to archeologists cannot be quantified adequately by sparse sets of landmarks or semilandmarks. Use of measurement conventions also requires that investigators know which aspects of the artifacts under consideration are important to include at the outset of an investigation. In this review results obtained from landmark-semilandmark-based, and image pixel-based assessments of a common set of Paleoindian fluted projectile points are compared. Results confirm that, by itself, PCA is unsuited for the assessment of between-group differences irrespective of data type, but can be useful as a transformation to reduce the dimensionality of a morphological dataset while retaining its effective information content. Landmark-semilandmark data analysed using geometric morphometric methods delivered the lowest-quality results whereas image pixel data analysed by the Naïve Bayes machine-learning classifier delivered the highest. Direct analyses of artifact images using geometric morphometric methods delivered very good results. These findings suggest that the direct analyses of digital images and 3D scans, using either geometric morphometric data-analysis methods or machine-learning procedures, can provide archaeologists with tools that improve and extend the scope of their assessments of a wide range of artifact types. © 2018 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data analysis; Discriminant analysis; Machine learning; Morphometrics; North America; Paleogeography; Paleoindian; Projectile points; Quaternary; Typology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.26 (Presnyakova et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Presnyakova, D., Braun, D.R., Conard, N.J., Feibel, C., Harris, J.W.K., Pop, C.M., Schlager, S., Archer, W. 56429690500;23972180300;6603626316;6603873935;55740177800;55860417700;48662907600;35085743300; Site fragmentation, hominin mobility and LCT variability reflected in the early Acheulean record of the Okote Member, at Koobi Fora, Kenya (2018) Journal of Human Evolution, 125, pp. 159-180.

The origins and production patterns of large bifacial cutting tools (‘LCTs’) – the marker of the Acheulean techno-complex – and the systematic changes in this behaviour through time are gaining increasing interest in paleoanthropology. Here we provide a synthesis of early Acheulean LCT variation in a landscape context by analysing assemblages from four different quasi-contemporaneous (∼1.4 Ma) sites from the Koobi Fora Formation. We characterize this variation using both 3D geometric morphometric and descriptive approaches. The expansive lateral exposures of fluvial and lacustrine sediments, as well as the associated tephrostratigraphy of the Koobi Fora Formation provide the landscape context that enables these comparative analyses. Our study demonstrates that when multiple contemporaneous early Acheulean localities are analysed together, a broader picture of LCT variability is elucidated. Four sites at Koobi Fora appear to represent a single system of lithic economy, characterized by a discrete trajectory of changes in LCT size and shape. These sites have ranges of LCT forms which appear to represent different but overlapping stages on a single reduction trajectory. Certain sites exhibit the full reduction trajectory while others exhibit only fragments of this trajectory. Other inter-site lithic proxies further complement these patterns in LCT variability. We explore patterns of site function, mobility and hominin landscape use, all of which may be suggestive of a depth of planning in early Acheulean hominins wherein technological activities were undertaken in substantial anticipation of future needs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Early Acheulean; Geometric morphometrics; Hominin behaviour; Landscape scale variation; Large cutting tools; Lithic analysis DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.27 (Limier et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Limier, B., Ivorra, S., Bouby, L., Figueiral, I., Chabal, L., Cabanis, M., Ater, M., Lacombe, T., Ros, J., Brémond, L., Terral, J.-F. 57204163442;14828273200;6602374494;6603067806;23984103300;23994967800;6603387124;23485802300;55899046100;6506805677;6603580109; Documenting the history of the grapevine and viticulture: A quantitative eco-anatomical perspective applied to modern and archaeological charcoal (2018) Journal of Archaeological Science, 100, pp. 45-61.

However, until now, grapevine charcoal remains from archaeological contexts were largely underexploited. In this study we describe the development of a quantitative anatomical method which aims to discriminate between the wild and cultivated grapevines based on a reference collection of modern individuals. The plasticity of grapevine anatomical characters was quantified in relation to maturity or age of wood and environmental conditions. For the first time, quantitative eco-anatomical features of charcoal from archaeological sites (South of France, Bronze Age - Modern Period) were compared to the reference models established beforehand. This procedure allowed us to identify the status (wild or cultivated-domesticated) of certain sub-fossil samples. Our results complement data from archaeobotany and from traditional and geometric morphometric analyses of Vitis pips. They confirm the collection/use of the wild grapevine during the Bronze Age and the exploitation of cultivated forms on coastal or near coastal sites (Mediterranean), from the Iron Age up to the Modern Period. Furthermore, the question of an early grapevine cultivation (5th c. BCE) in regions away from the sea is raised for the first time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Archaeobotany; Eco-anatomy; Vitis vinifera L.; Wild vs. cultivated-domesticated; Wood charcoal anatomy DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.28 (Herzlinger and Grosman 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Herzlinger, G., Grosman, L. 56910008800;25636007900; AGMT3-D: A software for 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis of archaeological artifacts (2018) PLoS ONE, 13 (11), art. no. e0207890, .

It is intended to provide archaeologists with a simple and easy-to-use tool for performing 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis on 3-D digital models of archaeological artifacts. It requires no prior knowledge of programming or proficiency in statistics. AGMT3-D consists of a data-acquisition procedure for automatically positioning 3-D models in space and fitting them with grids of 3-D semi-landmarks. It also provides a number of analytical tools and procedures that allow the processing and statistical analysis of the data, including generalized Procrustes analysis, principal component analysis, a warp tool, automatic calculation of shape variabilities and statistical tests. It provides an output of quantitative, objective and reproducible results in numerical, textual and graphic formats. These can be used to answer archaeologically significant questions relating to morphologies and morphological variabilities in artifact assemblages. Following the presentation of the software and its functions, we apply it to a case study addressing the effects of different types of raw material on the morphologies and morphological variabilities present in an experimentally produced Acheulian handaxe assemblage. The results show that there are statistically significant differences between the mean shapes and shape variabilities of handaxes produced on flint and those produced on basalt. With AGMT3-D, users can analyze artifact assemblages and address questions that are deducible from the morphologies and morphological variabilities of material culture assemblages. These questions can relate to issues of, among others, relative chronology, cultural affinities, tool function and production technology. AGMT3-D is aimed at making 3-D landmarks-based geometric morphometric shape analysis more accessible to archaeologists, in the hope that this method will become a tool commonly used by archaeologists. © 2018 Herzlinger, Grosman.

In regions with great taxonomic diversity, such as the Indo-Pacific, the identification of fish vertebrae to species is difficult. This results in taxonomic lists with many skeletal elements identified only to family. However family level identifications often tell us little about the environmental preferences of the fish and thus, by inference, human fishing practices. Here we apply geometric morphometrics (GM) to examine shape variations within vertebrae in modern specimens of a variety of pelagic and reef species to determine if this method can be used to reliably inform on habitat preferences. Digitized vertebral elements of reef (Acanthuridae, Balistidae, Labridae, Lethrinidae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) and pelagic/open water (Scombridae and Carangidae) families were scored using 2D landmarks. These were subjected to Generalized Procrustes Analysis and discriminatory multivariate analyses (Linear Discriminant Analysis and Discriminant Function Analysis) in order to assess whether shape can be used to differentiate habitats. Our results suggest that geometric morphometrics do allow the differentiation of habitat in vertebrae and provide an alternative method for the classification of archaeological fish assemblages. These analyses were applied to a sample of archaeological fish remains from a site in Alor Island (Nusa Tenggara Timur, Indonesia) and compared with the results of an earlier traditional comparative icthyoarchaeological analysis. We found that the main component of the Pleistocene marine human diet comprised reef species, with the sporadic addition of open water species, supporting the pattern recorded with traditional analyses. This methodology could be widely applied to archaeological fish material from across the Indo-Pacific allowing a greater number of bones in assemblages to contribute to insights into human exploitation of coastal habitats and fishing techniques over time. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Fish habitat; Geometric morphometrics; Icthyoarchaeology; Vertebrae; Wallacea; Zooarchaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.30 (Buchanan et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Buchanan, B., Andrews, B., O’Brien, M.J., Eren, M.I. 11241802300;26661326100;36128081000;23975681200; AN ASSESSMENT of STONE WEAPON TIP STANDARDIZATION during the CLOVIS-FOLSOM TRANSITION in the WESTERN United States (2018) American Antiquity, 83 (4), pp. 721-734.

Here, we address that deficiency by using data from a sample of Folsom and Clovis points recovered from sites across the western United States. We used geometric morphometric techniques to capture point shape and then conducted statistical analyses of variability associated with Clovis and Folsom point bases and blades. Our results demonstrate that Folsom bases and blades are less variable than those on earlier Clovis points, indicating an increase in point standardization during the Early Paleoindian period. In addition, despite published claims to the contrary, Clovis and Folsom point bases are no more variable than blades. Based on these results, we conducted additional analyses to examine the modularity and size of Clovis and Folsom points. The results suggest Clovis points have more integrated base and blade segments than Folsom points. We suggest that several classes of Clovis points - intended for different functions - might have been in use during the Clovis period and that the later Folsom points might have served only as weapon tips, the shape of which were constrained by the fluting process.

Davis sites. Results indicate a significant difference in Gahagan biface morphology at the Mounds Plantation site when compared with Gahagan bifaces from the Gahagan Mound and George C. Davis sites. Tests for allometry and asymmetry were not significant. The test of morphological disparity indicates that Gahagan bifaces produced at the Mounds Plantation site occupy a more restricted range of morphospace than those produced at Gahagan Mound, providing indirect evidence for standardisation and diversity in Caddo biface production. While the sample includes a wide range of variation in biface shapes, the test of morphological integration indicates that Gahagan bifaces are significantly integrated, meaning that those traits used to characterise their shape (blade and base) vary in a coordinated manner. These results articulate with a shift in Caddo bottle morphology over the same geography, potentially indicating two previously unrecognised and morphologically-distinct lithic and ceramic production areas. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D; American Southeast; Caddo; Geometric morphometrics; Morphological disparity; Morphological integration; Virtual archaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.32 (Mounier et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Mounier, A., Correia, M., Rivera, F., Crivellaro, F., Power, R., Jeffery, J., Wilshaw, A., Foley, R.A., Mirazón Lahr, M. 26031615600;57202239043;57072759300;19638325100;57072864400;57202233588;57073916700;7102887389;6603894491; Who were the Nataruk people?

However, the processes that underpinned the evolution of African populations remain largely obscure. Only a handful of late Pleistocene African fossils (∼50-12 Ka) are known, while the more numerous sites with human fossils of early Holocene age are patchily distributed. In particular, late Pleistocene and early Holocene human diversity in Eastern Africa remains little studied, precluding any analysis of the potential factors that shaped human diversity in the region, and more broadly throughout the continent. These periods include the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), a moment of extreme aridity in Africa that caused the fragmentation of population ranges and localised extinctions, as well as the ‘African Humid Period’ a moment of abrupt climate change and enhanced connectivity throughout Africa. East Africa, with its range of environments, may have acted as a refugium during the LGM, and may have played a critical biogeographic role during the heterogene’ous environmental recovery that followed. This environmental context raises a number of questions about the relationships among early Holocene African populations, and about the role played by East Africa in shaping late hunter-gatherer biological diversity. Here, we describe eight mandibles from Nataruk, an early Holocene site (∼10 Ka) in West Turkana, offering the opportunity of exploring population diversity in Africa at the height of the ‘African Humid Period’. We use 3D geometric morphometric techniques to analyze the phenotypic variation of a large mandibular sample. Our results show that (i) the Nataruk mandibles are most similar to other African hunter-fisher-gatherer populations, especially to the fossils from Lothagam, another West Turkana locality, and to other early Holocene fossils from the Central Rift Valley (Kenya); and (ii) a phylogenetic connection may have existed between these Eastern African populations and some Nile Valley and Maghrebian groups, who lived at a time when a Green Sahara may have allowed substantial contact, and potential gene flow, across a vast expanse of Northern and Eastern Africa. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Africa; Late human evolution; Mandibles; Nataruk; Phenetic; West-Turkana DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.33 (Rofes et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Rofes, J., Cucchi, T., Hanot, P., Herman, J., Stephan, P., Cersoy, S., Horáček, I., Kerr, E., Allberry, K., Valenzuela, S., Zazzo, A., Cornette, R., Tresset, A. 14619640800;6506822509;56303948700;8222147100;7005148001;37002626200;6603688948;57203573680;57204733657;36951937200;6602317727;6506350460;6506727552; Postglacial recolonization and Holocene diversification of Crocidura suaveolens (Mammalia, Soricidae) on the north-western fringe of the European continent (2018) Quaternary Science Reviews, 190, pp. 1-10.

Geometric morphometric methods were used to quantify variation in size and shape of the mandible. The phenotypic distance between populations, and the influence of several eco-geographical factors on the size and shape of the mandible in island populations, were assessed. Based on mandible shape divergence, the populations of C. suaveolens were clustered into continental, insular Atlantic and insular Mediterranean groups. Archaeological specimens from Molène Island, more than 3400 years old, display a mandible shape signal closer to that of the continental population than those of modern island populations. Conversely, the continental shape signals of the modern populations from Höedic and Sark suggest that these are relatively recent anthropogenic introductions. The populations of C. suaveolens from both the Atlantic and Mediterranean islands (except for Rouzic and Cyprus) show a significant increase in mandible size, compared to those from continental Europe. Significant phenotypic differences support the indigenous condition of C. suaveolens on most of the Atlantic islands, suggesting that the species arrived there before the separation of the Scilly Isles and Ushant from the continent due to the post-glacial rise in sea level. This provides an ante quem for its colonization of the north-western fringe of continental Europe, notwithstanding its absence from the region in the present day. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Data analysis; Eco-geographical constraints; Europe; Geometric morphometrics; Holocene; Island rule; Mandible; Paleogeography; Shape divergence DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.34 (Maté‐González et al. 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Maté-González, M.Á., Yravedra, J., Martín-Perea, D.M., Palomeque-González, J., San-Juan-Blazquez, M., Estaca-Gómez, V., Uribelarrea, D., Álvarez-Alonso, D., Cuartero, F., González-Aguilera, D., Domínguez-Rodrigo, M. 56780291300;56962776200;57192089446;56780262200;57192960468;57188553158;6507093504;55320183200;36476024800;24477009700;6603679662; Flint and Quartzite: Distinguishing Raw Material Through Bone Cut Marks (2018) Archaeometry, 60 (3), pp. 437-452.

Thus, metal tool use has been differentiated in contexts with an abundance of lithic tools, or even the use of hand axes has been documented in carcass processing, in contrast with simple unretouched or retouched flakes. As important as this information is, there are still other important aspects to be analysed. Can cut marks produced with different lithic raw material types be differentiated? Can cut marks made with different types of the same raw material type be characterized and differentiated? The objective of this study is to evaluate if cut marks resulting from the use of different flints and different quartzites are distinguishable from each other. In the present work, an experimental analysis of hundreds of cut marks produced by five types of flint and five varieties of quartzite was carried out. Microphotogrammetry and geometric–morphometric techniques were applied to analyse these cut marks. The results show that flint cut marks and quartzite cut marks can be characterized at the assemblage level. Different types of flint produced cut marks that were not significantly different from each other. Cut marks made with Olduvai Gorge quartzite were significantly different from those produced with a set comprising several other types of quartzites. Crystal size, which is larger in Olduvai Gorge quartzites (0.5 mm) than Spanish quartzites (177–250 μm), is discussed as being the main reason for these statistically significant differences. This documented intra-sample and inter-sample variance does not hinder the resolution of the approach to differentiate between these two generic raw material types and opens the door for the application of this method in archaeological contexts. © 2017 University of Oxford AUTHOR KEYWORDS: cut marks; flint; micro-morphometry; micro-photogrammetry; quartzite; raw materials DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.35 (Zanolli et al. 2018) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Zanolli, C., Pan, L., Dumoncel, J., Kullmer, O., Kundrát, M., Liu, W., Macchiarelli, R., Mancini, L., Schrenk, F., Tuniz, C. 35410978200;55539634900;55840120800;6508188094;24344146700;28567979400;6701717392;7103376845;6603042411;7003708200; Inner tooth morphology of Homo erectus from Zhoukoudian.

Most of the material collected before World War II was lost. However, besides two postcranial elements rediscovered in China in 1951, four human permanent teeth from the ‘Dragon Bone Hill,’ collected by O. Zdansky between 1921 and 1923, were at the time brought to the Paleontological Institute of Uppsala University, Sweden, where they are still stored. This small sample consists of an upper canine (PMU 25719), an upper third molar (PMU M3550), a lower third premolar crown (PMU M3549), and a lower fourth premolar (PMU M3887). Some researchers have noted the existence of morpho-dimensional differences between the Zhoukoudian and the H. erectus dental assemblage from Sangiran, Java. However, compared to its chrono-geographical distribution, the Early to Middle Pleistocene dental material currently forming the Chinese-Indonesian H. erectus hypodigm is quantitatively meager and still poorly characterized for the extent of its endostructural variation. We used micro-focus X-ray tomography techniques of virtual imaging coupled with geometric morphometrics for comparatively investigating the endostructural conformation (tissue proportions, enamel thickness distribution, enamel-dentine junction morphology, pulp cavity shape) of the four specimens stored in Uppsala, all previously reported for their outer features. The results suggest the existence of time-related differences between continental and insular Southeast Asian dental assemblages, the Middle Pleistocene Chinese teeth apparently retaining an inner signature closer to the likely primitive condition represented by the Early Pleistocene remains from Java, while the Indonesian stock evolved toward tooth structural simplification. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Chinese Homo erectus; Early Middle Pleistocene; Inner structure; Permanent teeth; Zhoukoudian DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.36 (Topi et al. 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Topi, J.R., VanPool, C.S., Waller, K.D., VanPool, T.L. 57201065508;14326369100;57196222504;14055200600; The economy of specialized ceramic craft production in the casas grandes region (2018) Latin American Antiquity, 29 (1), pp. 122-142.

Our research builds on such applications to examine the organization of production by applying GM analysis to whole ceramic vessels from the Casas Grandes culture of northwest Mexico. We quantify variation in vessel shape and size and conclude that specialists made at least some of the Ramos and Babicora Polychromes, but that the other Casas Grandes ceramic types were generally made by nonspecialists. This bolsters arguments for Medio period (AD 1200 to 1450) specialized production above the household level but indicates that specialized production was limited to a subset of economically valuable goods. We further suggest some Ramos Polychrome was made by attached specialists associated with elites at Paquime, the religious center of the Medio period, whereas some Babicora Polychrome was made by independent specialists. The analysis contributes to three important anthropological topics: (1) the study of the Medio period Casas Grandes culture, and by extension the organization of production in mid-level hierarchically organized societies; (2) geometric morphometric analysis of archaeological collections; and (3) the Standardization Hypothesis and the relationship between artifact standardization and the organization of production.

Research examining South American skeletons &gt;8000 cal BP has revealed differences in cranial morphology between early and late Holocene populations, which may reflect distinct migration events and/or populations. However, genetic, cultural, and some skeletal data contradict this model. Given these discrepancies, this study examines ∼9000 years of prehistory to test the hypothesis that Early skeletons have a distinct cranial morphology from later skeletons. Materials and Methods: Using 3D digital models, craniofacial landmarks, and geometric morphometric analyses, we compared Early Holocene crania (n = 4) to later Chilean samples (n = 90) frequently absent in continental assessments of craniofacial variation. PCA, Mahalanobis distances, posterior and typicality probabilities were used to examine variation. Results: Two of the earliest skeletons from northern Chile show clear affinities to individuals from later sites in the same region. However, the hypothesis cannot be rejected as one Early individual from northern Chile and one individual from inland Patagonia did not always show clear affinities to coastal populations. Discussion: Biological affinities among northern populations and other regions of Chile align with genetic and archaeological data, supporting cultural and biological continuity along the Pacific Coast. In Patagonia, archaeological data are in accordance with skeletal differences between the Early inland steppe individual and coastal populations. This study incorporates 3D methods and skeletal datasets not widely used in assessments of biological affinity, thus contributing to a critical body of research examining the ancient population history of western South America. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Behavioral interpretations of the fossil record hinge strongly upon correct assessment of BSMs. With the significant impact of microscopic analysis to the study of BSMs, multiple authors have discussed the reliability of these technological improvements for gaining resolution in BSM discrimination. While a certain optimism is present, some important questions are ignored and others overemphasized without appropriate empirical support. This specifically affects the study of cut marks. A diversity of geometric morphometric approaches applied to the study of cut marks have resulted in the coexistence (and competition) of different 2D and 3D methods. The present work builds upon the foundation of experiments presented by Maté-González et al. (2015), Courtenay et al. (2017) and Otárola-Castillo et al.

The overlap of their ecological niches has raised an important debate on the role that carnivores played in archaeological site formation. Different analytical techniques differentiate the action of carnivores and humans and identify the type of carnivore involved of which tooth mark analyses are prominent. However, available taphonomic studies present some limitations given the great overlap among tooth mark sizes from different carnivores, enabling only the distinction of size groups, not specific carnivores. In this work, we use a new technique combining three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction and geometric morphometrics (GMM) of tooth pits on equid and bovid bone created by different carnivores (including crocodiles, hyenas, jaguars, lions and wolves) in controlled settings. The 3D methodology we present isolates and differentiates tooth marks generated by different carnivores. We also test the applicability of the technique to ascribe tooth pits recorded on some hominin specimens from FLK Zinj and FLKNN 3 (Bed I, Olduvai Gorge). The tooth marks on the Olduvai OH8 and OH35 hominin fossils, previously assigned to crocodiles show that while OH8 tooth pit morphology falls in the range created by crocodiles, the pits on OH35 can not be interpreted as crocodile-inflicted marks. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

SSM is a full field, multi-material analytical technique, and is presented as a supplementary geometric morphometric (GM) tool. Lower mandibular canines from two archaeological populations and one modern population were sampled, digitised using micro-CT, aligned, registered to a baseline and statistically modelled using principal component analysis (PCA). Sample material properties were incorporated as a binary enamel/dentin parameter. Results were assessed qualitatively and quantitatively using anatomical landmarks. Finally, the technique’s application was demonstrated for inter-sample comparison through analysis of the principal component (PC) weights. It was found that SSM could provide high detail qualitative and quantitative insight with respect to archaeological inter- and intra-sample variability. This technique has value for archaeological, biomechanical and forensic applications including identification, finite element analysis (FEA) and reconstruction from partial datasets. © 2017 Woods et al.

However, poor chronological control has dissuaded similar studies of fluted points found in Alaska and northern Yukon and our understanding of their adaptive role in early arctic adaptations remains unclear. Two new archeological sites have provided reliable radiocarbon data and for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of northern fluted points is possible. Here, technological and morphological analyses of northern fluted points are presented, including variables statistically evaluated and compared to a collection of fluted Folsom artifacts serving as a reference. Variation in tool shape was measured using geometric morphometrics, and a new approach to landmark placement designed to characterize basal morphology and allow the analysis to include tool fragments is presented. Results confirm that northern fluted points represent a cohesive technological strategy and are used to formulate hypotheses suggesting its service as a risk-management system promoting ease-of-replacement-after-failure to offset transport costs and reduce risk during long-distance travel. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

However, sex determination using the skeletal remains of individuals who did not develop secondary sexual characteristics remains controversial. Accurately estimating the sex of subadults is hampered by a small number of studies based on identified skeletal collections of juvenile individuals. Here, we analyzed the sexual dimorphism of the subadult ilia using geometric morphometric techniques and individuals from the osteological collection of identified subadults from San José’s graveyard (Granada). Seventy-one left ilia from 40 males and 31 females aged between birth and 1 year were included in the analysis. Three landmarks and 27 semi-landmarks of the ilia were placed. By principal component analysis, we found that the size and shape of the ilia could be used to differentiate males and females. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

The impact of sea level variations related to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the Neolithic diffusion on past population dispersals are two key issues. We have investigated competing AMH dispersal hypotheses in SEA through the analysis of dental phenotype shape variation on the basis of very large archaeological samples employing two complementary approaches. We first explored the structure of between- and within-group shape variation of permanent human molar crowns. Second, we undertook a direct test of competing hypotheses through a modeling approach. Our results identify a significant LGM-mediated AMH expansion and a strong biological impact of the spread of Neolithic farmers into SEA during the Holocene. The present work thus favors a “multiple AMH dispersal” hypothesis for the population history of SEA, reconciling phenotypic and recent genomic data. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Contour analysis; Geometric morphometrics; Homo sapiens; Last Glacial Maximum; Neolithic expansion; Population history DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.44 (Bonhomme et al. 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Bonhomme, V., Forster, E., Wallace, M., Stillman, E., Charles, M., Jones, G. 55581390500;57189696846;55621822700;6601945184;7201434799;8761946200; Identification of inter- and intra-species variation in cereal grains through geometric morphometric analysis, and its resilience under experimental charring (2017) Journal of Archaeological Science, 86, pp. 60-67.

This paper uses geometric morphometrics, first, to explore variation in grain shape between three domesticated cereal species, einkorn (Triticum monococcum), emmer (Triticum dicoccum) and barley (Hordeum vulgare), both before and after experimental charring at 230 and 260 °C. Results demonstrate that outline analysis reliably reflects known variations in grain shape between species and differences due to charring observed in previous experimental work, and is capable of distinguishing the species, with near-perfect results, both before and after charring. Having established this, the same method was applied to different accessions of the same species, which indicated that three different grain morphotypes of einkorn and two, possibly three, of emmer could be identified in the uncharred material, and that at least two different morphotypes for each species could be distinguished even after charring at temperatures up to 260 °C. This opens up the possibility of tracking evolutionary change in crops, both chronologically and geographically, through morphometric analysis. © 2017 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Archaeobotany; Barley; Cereal grain; Einkorn; Elliptical Fourier transforms; Emmer; Experimental charring DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.45 (Herzlinger, Goren-Inbar, and Grosman 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Herzlinger, G., Goren-Inbar, N., Grosman, L. 56910008800;6602327672;25636007900; A new method for 3D geometric morphometric shape analysis: The case study of handaxe knapping skill (2017) Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, 14, pp. 163-173.

Scopus, Jerusalem, 91905, Israel; The Jack, Joseph and Morton Mandel School for Advanced Studies in the Humanities, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel ABSTRACT: The following study presents a novel method for computerized 3D geometric morphometric shape analysis of archaeological artifacts. It consists of a newly developed tool for automated positioning of 3D digital models and the following placement of 3D homologous landmarks for geometric morphometric analysis. It provides a quick and easy method for acquiring high-resolution 3D landmark coordinate data. This tool is applicable to a wide range of objects which have two opposed faces of relatively similar size and can be consistently positioned along their maximal length in planform view. The acquired data can be subjected to common multivariate statistical procedures for the quantitative description and analysis of shape variability in an assemblage. The method is applied here to a case study of experimentally produced assemblages of Acheulian handaxe replicas made by six knappers of differing skill levels. An analysis is performed to test whether the shapes of the handaxes can be used to classify them according to their knapper’s skill level. Generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA), principal component analysis (PCA) and discriminant analysis (DA) are applied to the landmarks’ coordinates. The results indicate that applying DA to PC scores allows a reliable classification of artifacts according to the skill level of their knappers, with a minimal misclassification rate. Thus, this method demonstrates that application of high-resolution 3D geometric morphometric methods can be used for the quantitative differentiation of skill levels based on tool morphology. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D geometric morphometrics; Acheulian handaxes; Discriminant analysis; Experimental archaeology; Homologous landmarks; Skill level DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.46 (Errickson et al. 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Errickson, D., Grueso, I., Griffith, S.J., Setchell, J.M., Thompson, T.J.U., Thompson, C.E.L., Gowland, R.L. 55661632700;57194068606;57191224960;6701625451;7401552868;55455493400;8413662400; Towards a Best Practice for the Use of Active Non-contact Surface Scanning to Record Human Skeletal Remains from Archaeological Contexts (2017) International Journal of Osteoarchaeology, 27 (4), pp. 650-661.

The use of active surface scanners to record anthropological and archaeological contexts has increased within the last few years, creating a number of sub-contexts within these disciplines and allowing a further development of certain applications, such as quantitative analysis, the use of replicas in education and museums and the creation of digital databases archived in institutions. However, with guidance, this paper aims to assess the advantages and disadvantages of active surface scanning and the potential for research with regard to the recording and analysis of human skeletal remains. The key advantages and uses identified include quantitative digitisation, geometric morphometric studies, conservation, preservation, documentation and reconstruction. However, surface scanning also has some limitations, including cost, technological expertise, the need for a power source, computing requirements and data size. Overall, the application of active surface scanning technology to archaeological skeletal remains will provide a vital digital archive that will serve to preserve the integrity of this fragile and finite resource for future generations. This is particularly important within the current developer-funded environment in which many skeletal collections, including those yielding unique or unusual pathological or morphological features, are re-buried, with only very limited time for analysis.

The analysis of these marks may permit us to know more about who was involved in the making the of prehistoric images as well as expanding the literature on the evolution of human behaviour. A number of researchers have previously attempted to identify the sex of the makers of Upper Palaeolithic hand stencils using methods based on hand size and digit length ratios obtained from digital or photo-based images of modern reference samples. Some analyses report that it was males who were responsible for the majority of hand stencils, whilst the most recent analysis determined that females produced the majority of hand stencils. Taken together, however, these studies generate contrasting and incompatible interpretations. In this study we critically review where we currently stand with methods of sexing the makers of hand stencils and the problems for the interpretation of hand markings of Palaeolithic age. We then present the results of a new method of predicting the sex of individuals from their hand stencils using a geometric morphometric approach that detects sexual differences in hand shape and hand form (size and shape). The method has the additional advantage of being able to detect these differences in both complete, as well as partial hand stencils. Finally we urge researchers to test this method on other ethnic groups and populations and consider ways of combining efforts towards a common goal of developing a robust, predictive methodology based on diverse modern samples before it is applied to Upper Palaeolithic hand stencils. © 2016 The Authors AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Biometrics; Cave art; Forensic anthropology; Geometric morphometrics; Palaeolithic; Sex assessment DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final ACCESS TYPE: Open Access SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.48 (Hanot et al. 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Hanot, P., Guintard, C., Lepetz, S., Cornette, R. 56303948700;6602112945;26036377000;6506350460; Identifying domestic horses, donkeys and hybrids from archaeological deposits: A 3D morphological investigation on skeletons (2017) Journal of Archaeological Science, 78, pp. 88-98.

Latin authors described donkeys as being particularly suitable for the transport of goods and farm work. In addition, they were also bred to produce prized hybrids, particularly mules, which were perfectly adapted to the long-distance transport of people and goods. However, although the historical sources extensively describe their economic importance, both donkey and hybrid remains are surprisingly scarce in the archaeological record. This apparent contradiction is probably due to the difficulties involved in correctly identifying their bones: relatively few bones displaying morphological and metrical criteria can be used for identification, so it is often based purely on bone size. The aim of this study, therefore, is to propose solutions to identify domestic equid bones using 3D geometric morphometrics on isolated and combinations of anatomical elements. A set of 3D coordinates were registered on the 18 main skull and limb bones of 111 modern reference specimens (i.e. 42 horses, 44 donkeys and 25 hybrids). In this paper, we present the classification rate obtained on this reference sample using the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. The application of this method on archaeological skeletons from Roman to modern sites is also presented. The percentage of correctly classified specimens was between 77% and 95% for all 18 bones, and higher than 80% for 10 of the fragmentation patterns we defined. Using a combination of several bones enabled us to increase the rate of correct reclassification to a maximum of 97%. The application to archaeological skeletons proved the ability of this method to identify domestic horses and donkeys from archaeological samples. Correspondingly, some bones, and especially combinations of bones, provided good rates to identify hybrids. This method has proved reliable in detecting the presence of donkeys and hybrids from the archaeological samples of equid bones, and should enrich our knowledge regarding their spread across Europe. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D geometric morphometrics; Equus; Species identification; Zooarchaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.49 (Marquez, Primost, and Bigatti 2017) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Márquez, F., Primost, M.A., Bigatti, G. 14832998300;26026486400;6603270408; Shell shape as a biomarker of marine pollution historic increase (2017) Marine Pollution Bulletin, 114 (2), pp. 816-820.

Population and maritime industries has incremented pollution in Nuevo gulf harbor since 1970s, promoting morphological changes in B. globulosus shell shape. We study the shell shape of the species comparing present day’s specimens from the harbor zone with those collected in the same zone before the increasing of maritime activity and pre-Hispanic archaeological Middens. We demonstrated that harbor pollution produces globular shell shape in B. globulosus, an effect that probably allows gastropods to isolate themselves from the external adverse environment. On the contrary, shells from pre-Hispanic periods, unpolluted sites and those collected before the expansion of maritime activities, presented an elongated shell shape. Our study confirms that shell shape variation in marine gastropods can be used as a biomarker of harbor pollution. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Gastropod shell; Geometric morphometrics; Harbor pollution; Patagonia DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.50 (Kuzminsky et al. 2016) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Kuzminsky, S.C., Tung, T.A., Hubbe, M., Villaseñor-Marchal, A. 42661433900;8571474900;10338946900;57192159433; The application of 3D geometric morphometrics and laser surface scanning to investigate the standardization of cranial vault modification in the Andes (2016) Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports, 10, pp. 507-513.

While previous studies have enriched our understanding of these practices among prehistoric Andean populations, the introduction of 3D surface scanners and geometric morphometric methods in archaeology enable us to examine head-shaping practices in novel ways. In this pilot study, we used a NextEngine 3D Laser Surface Scanner to generate high resolution models of artificially modified crania from four archaeological sites dating to the Archaic (2300–1600 BCE), Formative (500 CE), late Middle Horizon/early Late Intermediate period (LIP) (750–1100 CE) in Chile and late LIP crania (circa 1350 CE) from central, highland Peru. Landmarks were recorded on the 3D digital models of crania and these data were analyzed to assess variation in vault shape within and between the samples. Results of the PCA analysis showed graphical separation of the annular, tabular erect, and some tabular oblique types even when gross morphological assessments proved challenging. We documented marked variation within the general modification type traditionally identified as tabular oblique, which suggests more detailed classifications within this type are needed. We also investigated how standardized (i.e., similar) particular cranial modification types were at each site, and results show that the coastal sites of Morro 1 and Playa Miller 7, and the highlands Huari-Vegachayoc Moqo site show higher levels of standardization than the other four samples. This study highlights the utility of 3D imaging and geometric morphometric methods for straightforward, objective assessments of cranial modification and levels of standardization within sites and within particular modification types. This has implications for understanding the broader social and cultural significance of this practice, such as whether there were shared cultural norms about how a head should be modified, which could have led to highly uniform modification practices and head shapes in the Andes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: 3D laser scanning; Andean archaeology; Archaeological science; Bioarchaeology; Biocultural anthropology; Cranial vault modification; Social identity DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final ACCESS TYPE: Open Access SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.51 (Field et al. 2016) Scopus EXPORT DATE:07 Apr 2020 Field, J.H., Kealhofer, L., Cosgrove, R., Coster, A.C.F. 35239626800;6602327303;7003898463;7003984165; Human-environment dynamics during the Holocene in the Australian Wet Tropics of NE Queensland: A starch and phytolith study (2016) Journal of Anthropological Archaeology, 44, pp. 216-234.

In contrast to most other tropical regions, permanent settlement in Australian rainforests developed much later, and in the absence of adjacent agricultural economies. Here we explore how the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland were exploited during the late Holocene through an ancient starch and phytolith record spanning the last 2000 years. Sequences at the two sites under study – Urumbal Pocket (a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ surrounded by rainforest) and Goddard Creek (within the rainforest) – indicate a human presence since the early Holocene, coincident with the re-establishment of rainforest in the region. Toxic starchy nuts and the associated complex processing underpinned permanent settlement. Using a geometric morphometric approach to starch analysis, a range of economic starch producing plant species were identified including Endiandra palmerstonii, E. insignis, Lasjia whelani and Beilschmiedia bancroftii in the Urumbal pocket sequence. The phytolith record shows that Urumbal Pocket has been a ‘Eucalyptus pocket’ for at least the last 2000 years, the open nature of the vegetation maintained by regular burning. Goddard Creek, on the other hand has been closed forest, with a changing profile as fire was used more frequently over time. The starch and phytolith sequence provide a unique insight into the local history of these rainforest archaeological sites, with a record that can be viewed against the backdrop of regional sequences documenting climatic and environmental patterns during the late Holocene. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.
