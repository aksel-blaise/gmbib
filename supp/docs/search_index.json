Selden, Jr.; Christian S. Hoggard; and Sarah Y. Stark 2020-04-06 Preface The notion that one can begin anything at all from scratch, free from the past, or unindebted to others, could not conceivably be more wrong (Magee 1974, 69). This volume is written in Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the manuscript. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. How do we know what we know? Upon whose work will this new project build? How have others addressed a particular problem in their research? In practice, the production of reliable knowledge is among the paramount goals of archaeology. Such knowledge provides the requisite foundation needed to advance our efforts to interpret and improve upon our shared understanding of the past. Recent methodological advances in bibliometrics provide a useful toolkit for approaching these important questions systematically, and visualizing the results. What follows is an example of a bibliometric study of indexed publications related to geometric morphometrics in archaeology. 0.1 Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the MORPHMET and Morph2016-2019 communities, as well as our colleagues at archaeologicalmorphometrics.com for their comments on earlier versions of the networks. This volume enlists a variety of tools from the Open Review Toolkit, as well as the code provided for the bookdown package, and follows the excellent example advanced by Ben Marwick. I extend my gratitude to all who contribute comments and constructive criticisms throughout the development and maturation of this project. This document will remain in open review until the manuscript is published. 0.2 Funding Funding for this project was provided to RZS by the United States Forest Service, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033 and 20-PA-11081300-074), and components of the analytical work flow were developed and funded by a grant to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 PRISMA", " Chapter 1 Introduction The initial step in any bibliometric study is one of logic, primarily Boolean logic (Figure 1), used to ensure that the bulk of those publications harvested in the study are relevant to the question at hand. In this case, geometric morphometrics in archaeology is the topic of interest; thus, the query employed for this study was “geometric morphometric” AND (archeology OR archaeology), which yielded 103 results in Scopus. knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;./figs/boolean.png&quot;)) Figure 1.1: Example of query results that employ Boolean operators. The structure of the query used in this study most closely matches the second venn diagram from the right. 1.1 PRISMA While neither a formal systematic review or a meta-analysis his study enlisted the work-flow of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysese (PRISMA) (Liberati et al. 2009), as a means of improving reporting. There is no shortage of unindexed publications on the topic in question; however, the focus of this particular study relied only on those works included in Scopus, which includes a complementary record for the cited works from each publication. The single publication omitted from the study did not include an application of geometric morphometrics; rather, it discussed how the methods of geometric morphometrics might be applied. # PRISMA flow diagram # install.packages(&quot;PRISMAstatement&quot;) #if not installed, remove the hash at the beginning of this line library(PRISMAstatement) prisma(found = 103, found_other = 0, no_dupes = 103, screened = 103, screen_exclusions = 1, full_text = 102, full_text_exclusions = 0, qualitative = 102, quantitative = 102) References "],

This article reviews established methods of quantifying shape in ship and boat archaeology—linear measurement ratios and form coefficients—and evaluates the utility of 3D geometric morphometrics (GM). The 3D shape of 30 vessels from north-west Europe dating between 325 BC and AD 1915 are quantified to study how hull shape relates to a vessel’s function and intended operating environment. A comparison of the three methods highlights the importance of analysing the complexity of a hull in a holistic manner and demonstrates that 3D GM outperforms the traditional methods. © 2020 The Authors.

The ancestors of the Inuit were the first to introduce the widespread usage of dog sledge transportation technology to the Americas, but whether the Inuit adopted local Palaeo-Inuit dogs or introduced a new dog population to the region remains unknown. To test these hypotheses, we generated mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometric data of skull and dental elements from a total of 922 North American Arctic dogs and wolves spanning over 4500 years. Our analyses revealed that dogs from Inuit sites dating from2000 BP possess morphological and genetic signatures that distinguish them from earlier Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and identified a novel mitochondrial clade in eastern Siberia and Alaska. The genetic legacy of these Inuit dogs survives today in modern Arctic sledge dogs despite phenotypic differences between archaeological and modern Arctic dogs. Together, our data reveal that Inuit dogs derive from a secondary pre-contact migration of dogs distinct from Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and probably aided the Inuit expansion across the North American Arctic beginning around 1000 BP. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This type of artefact was used to ignite the powder of firearms through a flintlock mechanism from the middle-seventeenth to the early-twentieth century in different contexts around the world. Taking what is a novel and exploratory approach in historical archaeology, this paper offers a quantitative analysis of a random sample of 200 unused gunflints recovered from the British shipwreck Deltebre I. This cargo ship belonged to an allied convoy that unsuccessfully tried to liberate Tarragona city from the Napoleonic forces, and sunk in the Ebro river delta, Catalonia, Spain, in 1813. The results from size and shape characterisation of the unused gunflints using geometric morphometric methods are presented. In order to assess morphometric variation between used and unused artefacts, this sample was compared with published images of 22 used British gunflints from different archaeological contexts. Finally, the usefulness of applied methodology to quantitatively characterise the design and morphometric variations of this kind of artefacts is highlighted. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Studies of North African fossil microvertebrates have increased considerably in recent years, but they no longer just provide palaeontological descriptions of the species found in the assemblages. They also aim at better understanding the evolution of faunal communities in relation to Quaternary climate changes and at reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental background of prehistoric human occupations, in well-established taphonomic and chronological contexts. These studies are also increasingly adopting an integrative approach by combining archaeology, palaeontology, (palaeo)genetics, taphonomy, palaeoecology and systematics, and using new methods such as geometric morphometrics and isotopic analyses on both fossil and modern specimens. This paper aims to present a history of the studies on Quaternary terrestrial microvertebrates from northwestern Africa, and show how recent multidisciplinary studies have provided new perspectives and evidence on the respective influences of climate change and increasing human pressure on their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Herpetofauna; Integrative approach; Maghreb; Micromammals DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.5 (Natahi et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Natahi, S., Coquerelle, M., Pereira, G., Bayle, P. 57210429853;36140239700;36192143700;35434353800; Neurocranial shape variation among Tarascan populations: Evidence for varying degrees in artificially modified crania in pre-Hispanic West Mexico (1200–1400 AD) (2019) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 170 (3), pp. 418-432. https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070705630&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajpa.23917&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9848cacbc1a4f7470334281e873f0428 DOI: 10.1002/ajpa.23917 AFFILIATIONS: Université de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, UMR 5199 PACEA, Pessac, France; Department of Medicine and Surgery (Stomatology Area), Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Alcorcón, Spain; UMR 8096, Archéologie des Amériques, CNRS, Maison René-Ginouvès, Nanterre, France ABSTRACT: Introduction: Along the Mesoamerican western margin, the Zacapu basin has yielded a large number of human remains demonstrating usage of artificial cranial modification (ACM). However, at the onset of the Middle Postclassic (1200–1400 AD) only few individuals still exhibit clear signs of ACM. Some authors have suggested that, rather than disappearing entirely, ACM may have become less visible anatomically, making it difficult to identify based on simple visual analyses. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometric methods to investigate the extent to which ACM persisted during the Postclassic in this region. Materials and methods: We measured the 3D vault’s shape changes in a sample of surface-scanned human crania: 55 individuals from the Postclassic Zacapu basin and a control group of 31 individuals from a Huichol Mexican Indian sample and a French medieval series from La Granède. We used a principal component analysis to explore the shape variation within the sample and employed the neighbor joining method to identify morphological groups. Finally, we quantified each individual’s asymmetry. Results: We identified three groups displaying shape features diverging from those of the control group. The first group is characterized by marked fronto-obelionic ACM, whereas the other two show mild forms of ACM. The individuals in all three groups display moderate to high degrees of asymmetry compared to the control group. Discussion: The marked fronto-obelionic modification is clear evidence of a specific ACM technique. The two types of mild ACM most likely result from different techniques but their moderate degree of modification brings into question the intentions behind their production. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The history of bere on these islands is long and, in an era of diminishing landrace cultivation, bere now represents one of the oldest cereal landraces in Europe still grown commercially. The longevity of bere raises the possibility of using grain characteristics of present-day specimens to identify bere in the archaeological record. Geometric modern morphometric (GMM) analysis of grains from bere and other barley landraces is conducted to determine whether landraces can be differentiated on grain morphology. Results indicate that there are morphological differences between bere and other British and Scandinavian landraces, and between bere from Orkney and the Western Isles, both of which are apparent in genetic analysis. This finding paves the way for the identification of bere archaeologically, helping to establish its status as living heritage and securing its commercial future. More broadly, this work indicates the potential of grain GMM for the recognition of cereal landraces, permitting the ancestry and exchange of landraces to be traced in the archaeological record. © 2018, The Author(s).

The lower archaeological levels of BK are characterized by anthropogenic activity related to the exploitation of megafauna (elephant, hippopotamus, Sivatherium) and smaller game (zebra, wildebeest and antelopes). These remains display a high frequency of cut marks. The exceptional state of preservation of the BK fossil assemblage has allowed a wide range of different analyses that, among other things, detected the use of quartzite in butchering activities through the study of cut marks. Following up previous analyses, this paper presents the study of a series of cut marks from the BK faunal assemblage using a 3D geometric morphometric methodological approach in order to determine the mineralogical properties of the quartzite used at the site. BK cut marks are compared with experimentally produced cut marks using 9 mineralogically different quartzite types from Olduvai Gorge. This comparative analysis provides valuable hints about the exact nature of the raw materials used in butchering activities. The results presented here identify a preferential use of quartzite with a finer granular composition, suggesting that hominin populations were already selecting the best raw materials for their use in specific activities 1.3 Mya. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cut mark morphology; Experimental archaeology; Homo erectus; Olduvai gorge; Quartzite; Taphonomy DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.8 (Pelletier 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Pelletier, M. 56677378300; Morphological diversity of wild rabbit populations: Implications for archaeology and palaeontology (2019) Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 128 (1), art. no. blz074, pp. 211-224.

However, the variability of these characteristics is still both poorly understood and under-documented due to a lack of population-level data that are essential for reliably interpreting the fossil record of this species. Here we address the morphometric diversity of wild rabbits in seven current populations from south-western Europe. Size variations in different skeletal parts were analysed to explore the potential impact of sexual dimorphism. A geometric morphometric analysis of the third lower premolar (p3) - a tooth commonly used to distinguish leporid species - was used to evaluate the relative effects of size, phylogeny, geographical location and climate on shape variation. The results show a negligible impact of sexual dimorphism, contradicting previous studies. We also demonstrate geography and climate to be the main factors driving variation in p3 shape, potentially calling into question criteria typically used to identify rabbit species. These results are valuable not only for palaeobiologists studying the taxonomy and the evolutionary history of the leporid family but also for archaeologists interested in the socio-economic and behavioural aspects of Palaeolithic human groups. © 2019 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society.

The shape of the external basicranial portion of the temporal bone, in particular, has been found to have one of the strongest phylogenetic signals in the crania, and so it can be effectively used to distinguish between populations on a large, often global scale. However, its applicability to the analysis of relatively closely-related groups remains largely unexplored. The retention of population signatures in the shape of this portion of the temporal bone is particularly useful for archaeology, as the fragility of the cranium makes analysis of its shape in entirety often difficult. If the shape of the temporal bone can identify differences between relatively closely-related populations with a similar accuracy as for more distantly-related populations, this would significantly aid analyses of population history on a local scale. To test this, we initiated a study that used three-dimensional geometric morphometrics to investigate the shape variation of the temporal bone of two British archaeological populations that were separated both temporally and geographically. The results of a MANOVA found statistically significant shape differences between the two populations and a DFA found that the shape of the temporal bone can correctly classify 84.7% of individuals into their respective population. Therefore, the findings of this study suggest that the shape of the temporal bone can accurately identify differences between two relatively closely-related populations. Future research should focus on examining larger samples from a greater number of populations to determine whether this pattern is widespread. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cranial shape; Human variation; Identification; Portmahomack; Poundbury; Relatedness; Shape analyses DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.10 (Haruda et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Haruda, A.F., Varfolomeev, V., Goriachev, A., Yermolayeva, A., Outram, A.K. 57192678397;36992540600;57208694507;57208683323;8954776500; A new zooarchaeological application for geometric morphometric methods: Distinguishing Ovis aries morphotypes to address connectivity and mobility of prehistoric Central Asian pastoralists (2019) Journal of Archaeological Science, 107, pp. 50-57.

However, there has been limited utilization of these methods to discriminate between populations of the same taxa to challenge and refine other key archaeological issues, such as migration and connectivity in prehistory. Presented here is a novel application of a three-dimensional landmark based geometric morphometric approach to address the nature of long distance trade and connectivity on the prehistoric Silk Road. The similarity of Bronze and Iron Age archaeological cultures along this steppe route has encouraged characterisations of these people as nomads, with highly mobile, integrated, and connected human and animal populations. However, the interconnectedness of domestic animal populations, in particular sheep (Ovis aries), the foundation of this prehistoric pastoral economy, has never been examined. This study utilized geometric morphometric methods to quantify geometric morphometric variance of O. aries astragali between three geographically disparate settlement sites within a single Final Bronze age cultural and chronological context. Significant differences between morphotypes revealed that protracted mobility patterns were unlikely and that while animal exchange may have occurred, it was not pervasive enough to produce a uniform sheep morphotype across central and southeastern Kazakhstan. The result of this new application of geometric morphometric methods challenges models of uniform and undifferentiated long distance mobility and economic connectivity between the peoples of the Silk Road. © 2019 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Bronze age; Central Asia; Geometric morphometrics; Ovis aries; Pastoralism; Three-dimensional digitisation; Zooarchaeology DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.11 (Yravedra Sainz de los Terreros, Maté-González, and Courtenay 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Yravedra Sainz de los Terreros, J., Maté-González, M.Á., Courtenay, L.A. 57209685315;56780291300;57200549280; New technologies applied to archaeology.

The use of multivariate statistics and the most recent advances in microscopic analysis of Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) have enable a less subjective interpretation of site formation processes. Nevertheless, this broader range of methodological approaches also presents some problems. The capacity of laser scanners in processing inconspicuous and superficial cortical alterations, such as trampling marks, has proven to be problematic. This study presents a new advance towards resolving this problem through the use of the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, whereby detailed digital three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions are able to pick up such minute BSMs. Through the statistical comparison of the David Laser scanner and the HIROX KH-8700 Digital Microscope, this paper contributes to our understanding of said equipment, followed by a significant advance in the characterisation of superficial BSMs. The combination of advanced microscopy and the application of geometric morphometrics highlights a morphological differentiation between two different types of trampling marks, hereby named scratch and graze trampling marks. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Bone surface modifications (BSM); Geometric morphometrics; Microscopy; Taphonomy DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.13 (Linares-Matás et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Linares-Matás, G.J., Yravedra, J., Maté-González, M.Á., Courtenay, L.A., Aramendi, J., Cuartero, F., González-Aguilera, D. 57202464782;56962776200;56780291300;57200549280;55827562600;36476024800;24477009700; A geometric-morphometric assessment of three-dimensional models of experimental cut-marks using flint and quartzite flakes and handaxes (2019) Quaternary International, 517, pp. 45-54.

Identification of micro-morphological variability between different taphonomical alterations on ancient bone allows detection and comparison of bone-surface modifications and associated taphonomical agents and activities. By taking a geometrical-morphometrical approach, data from 3-D laser-scanning and micro-photogrammetrical models of experimental cut-marks enable statistical analysis to classify and distinguish between cut-marks by bifaces from those by flakes, and, in each case, between marks made by flint from those made by quartzite tools. Analysis of two tool types, each made from two raw materials as independent variables, is a methodological advance in morphometrical studies of experimental cut-marks, which hitherto have tended to focus on the respective parts played by tool types or types of raw material in morphometrical characterization of experimental and archaeological cut-marks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Cut-marks; Experimental archaeology; High-resolution taphonomy; Multivariate statistics; Palaeolithic technology; Raw materials DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.14 (L.

This debate, commonly known as the hunter-scavenger debate, fostered the emergence of a new research line into the Bone Surface Modifications (BSMs) produced by both taphonomic agents. Throughout the following 20 years, multiple studies concerning the action of carnivores have been developed, with a particular focus on the oldest archaeological sites in East Africa. Recent technological advances applied to taphonomy have provided new insight into carnivore BSMs. A newly developed part of this work relies on Geometric Morphometrics (GMM) studies aimed at discerning carnivore agency through the morphologic characterization of tooth scores and pits. GMM studies have produced promising results, however methodological limitations are still present. This paper presents the first combined application of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and GMM to the analysis of carnivore tooth marks, generating classification rates of 100% between carnivore species in some cases. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and methods: The sample comprises 76 adult skulls from five archaeological sites, ranging from 4,500 to 1,530 BP. 3D geometric morphometrics, multivariate statistics, quantitative evolutionary genetic and biodistance analyses were performed to study the diachronic variation in craniofacial morphology. Analyses were performed on two cranial modules: the face and the cranial vault, across three major diachronic groups representing the late Neolithic (LNA), the Bronze Age (BA), and the Han-Jin dynasty (HD). Results: Average regional FST for both cranial modules was low, indicating relatively greater variation within diachronic groups than among them. While the LNA and BA groups did not show any significant differences in facial and vault shape, significant craniofacial shape changes were detected between the BA and HD groups. Discussion: The consistent craniofacial morphology during the LNA and the BA, and the shift in morphology between the BA and the HD indicates that cultural discontinuity does not always coincide with biological discontinuity. The Hehuang population evolved in situ with few changes, despite cultural and dietary changes, until the HD when migrations from the Central Plains are associated with extra-local gene flow to the area. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

BP. Ichnological data enable us to shed light on individual and group level behavior, social relationship, and mode of exploration of the uneven terrain. Five individuals, two adults, an adolescent and two children, entered the cave barefoot and illuminated the way with a bunch of wooden sticks. Traces of crawling locomotion are documented for the first time in the global human ichnological record. Anatomical details recognizable in the crawling traces show that no clothing was present between limbs and the trampled sediments. Our study demonstrates that very young children (the youngest about 3 years old) were active members of the Upper Palaeolithic populations, even in apparently dangerous and social activities. © Romano et al.

Archaeometry and Archaeological Analysis, Complutense University, Professor Aranguren s/n, Madrid, 28040, Spain ABSTRACT: The arrival of new methodological approaches to study microscopic qualities in cut mark morphology has been a major improvement in our understanding of butchering activities. Micro-morphological differences can be detected in multiple different taphonomic alterations on bone cortical surfaces that can later be used to compare different trace mark types. Through this, we can generate studies that are able to diagnose the specific taphonomic agents and activities that produce said traces that can be found on osteological surfaces. This paper presents experimental data that have been studied using micro-photogrammetry and geometric morphometrics, successfully distinguishing morphological differences in cut marks produced by different lithic tool types as well as different raw materials. The statistical results and methodologies presented here can later be applied to archaeological sites; aiding in our understanding of raw material exploitation, tool production as well as the different butchering activities that are present in faunal assemblages. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

The application of GM in archaeological materials has seen a sharp increase in the last decade, mostly associated with theoretical approaches from Evolutionary Archaeology. This is not an isolated case, since most methods used by Evolutionary Archaeologists have been borrowed from Biology, provoking discussion with regard to the future development of Evolutionary Archaeology and its methods (Lycett, 2015). This article aims to discuss some concepts that have been directly borrowed from the application of GM in Biological Sciences and that have not been subject to much thought when used in Archaeology. Such concepts include homology and landmark types, the concept of modularity, as well as the idea of allometry. As much as archaeologists using GM can learn from past discussions held by biologists regarding the above mentioned concepts, it is high time for archaeologists to further discuss ideas concerning the use of these concepts in archaeological studies. © 2017 AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Evolutionary Archaeology; Geometric Morphometrics; Interdisciplinarity; Stone tools DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.19 (Thulman 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Thulman, D.K. 33768076600; A Typology of Florida Fluted Points Using Landmark-based Geometric Morphometrics (2019) PaleoAmerica, .

Three highly distinctive types were discriminated using the shapes of the point bases. LGM is a powerful method for discriminating shapes, so paying close attention to analytical details is crucial for meaningful analyses. In archaeology, LGM is in its relative infancy compared to its use in biology, and archaeologists have not settled on standard procedures for its use in artifact shape analysis. Several general issues in the use of LGM for artifact-shape discrimination are discussed and illustrated, especially the effects of sample size and the Pinocchio Effect, in which highly variable aspects of an artifact shape, such as the fluted point blade, can affect analyses in unintended ways. The choices made in creating this typology are discussed in detail and alternatives tested to show how choices can significantly change results and archaeological interpretations. © 2019, © 2019 Center for the Study of the First Americans.

This discrimination is hindered by equifinality, i.e., BSM with similar morphologies that were produced by different agents. Here we propose a new method to identify the taphonomic agents responsible for BSM and apply it to an experimental data set containing 177 BSM produced by anthropogenic (stone tool-induced cut marks) and non-anthropogenic agents (carnivoran and crocodylian bite marks, and trampling marks). We used 3D topographic models of BSM built from confocal microscopy and applied geometric morphometrics-based shape and size analyses to cross-sectional profiles extracted from the BSM. The new method considers both average profiles and intra-mark variability of profiles. Multivariate analyses of several shape and size variables result in a new synthetic morphospace where anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic BSM show very little overlap. © 2019 International Conference on Metrology for Archaeology and Cultural Heritage.
