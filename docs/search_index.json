Selden, Jr.; Christian S. Hoggard; and Sarah Y. Stark 2020-04-06 Preface The notion that one can begin anything at all from scratch, free from the past, or unindebted to others, could not conceivably be more wrong (Magee 1974, 69). This volume is written in Markdown, and includes all analysis code employed in the study, providing a means for others to reproduce (exactly) those results discussed and expounded upon in the manuscript. The reproducible nature of this undertaking provides a means for others to critically assess and evaluate the various analytical components of this study (Gray and Marwick 2019; Peng 2011; Gandrud 2014), which is a necessary requirement for the production of reliable knowledge. How do we know what we know? Upon whose work will this new project build? How have others addressed a particular problem in their research? In practice, the production of reliable knowledge is among the paramount goals of archaeology. Such knowledge provides the requisite foundation needed to advance our efforts to interpret and improve upon our shared understanding of the past. Recent methodological advances in bibliometrics provide a useful toolkit for approaching these important questions systematically, and visualizing the results. What follows is an example of a bibliometric study of indexed publications related to geometric morphometrics in archaeology. 0.1 Acknowledgments We extend our gratitude to the MORPHMET and Morph2016-2019 communities, as well as our colleagues at archaeologicalmorphometrics.com for their comments on earlier versions of the networks. This volume enlists a variety of tools from the Open Review Toolkit, as well as the code provided for the bookdown package, and follows the excellent example advanced by Ben Marwick. I extend my gratitude to all who contribute comments and constructive criticisms throughout the development and maturation of this project. This document will remain in open review until the manuscript is published. 0.2 Funding Funding for this project was provided to RZS by the United States Forest Service, National Forests and Grasslands in Texas (15-PA-11081300-033 and 20-PA-11081300-074), and components of the analytical work flow were developed and funded by a grant to RZS from the National Center for Preservation Technology and Training.

["introduction.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction 1.1 PRISMA", " Chapter 1 Introduction The initial step in any bibliometric study is one of logic, primarily Boolean logic (Figure 1), used to ensure that the bulk of those publications harvested in the study are relevant to the question at hand. In this case, geometric morphometrics in archaeology is the topic of interest; thus, the query employed for this study was “geometric morphometric” AND (archeology OR archaeology), which yielded 103 results in Scopus. knitr::include_graphics(rep(&quot;./figs/boolean.png&quot;)) Figure 1.1: Example of query results that employ Boolean operators. The structure of the query used in this study most closely matches the second venn diagram from the right. 1.1 PRISMA While neither a formal systematic review or a meta-analysis his study enlisted the work-flow of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysese (PRISMA) (Liberati et al. 2009), as a means of improving reporting. There is no shortage of unindexed publications on the topic in question; however, the focus of this particular study relied only on those works included in Scopus, which includes a complementary record for the cited works from each publication. The single publication omitted from the study did not include an application of geometric morphometrics; rather, it discussed how the methods of geometric morphometrics might be applied. # PRISMA flow diagram # install.packages(&quot;PRISMAstatement&quot;) #if not installed, remove the hash at the beginning of this line library(PRISMAstatement) prisma(found = 103, found_other = 0, no_dupes = 103, screened = 103, screen_exclusions = 1, full_text = 102, full_text_exclusions = 0, qualitative = 102, quantitative = 102) References "],

This article reviews established methods of quantifying shape in ship and boat archaeology—linear measurement ratios and form coefficients—and evaluates the utility of 3D geometric morphometrics (GM). The 3D shape of 30 vessels from north-west Europe dating between 325 BC and AD 1915 are quantified to study how hull shape relates to a vessel’s function and intended operating environment. A comparison of the three methods highlights the importance of analysing the complexity of a hull in a holistic manner and demonstrates that 3D GM outperforms the traditional methods. © 2020 The Authors.

The ancestors of the Inuit were the first to introduce the widespread usage of dog sledge transportation technology to the Americas, but whether the Inuit adopted local Palaeo-Inuit dogs or introduced a new dog population to the region remains unknown. To test these hypotheses, we generated mitochondrial DNA and geometric morphometric data of skull and dental elements from a total of 922 North American Arctic dogs and wolves spanning over 4500 years. Our analyses revealed that dogs from Inuit sites dating from2000 BP possess morphological and genetic signatures that distinguish them from earlier Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and identified a novel mitochondrial clade in eastern Siberia and Alaska. The genetic legacy of these Inuit dogs survives today in modern Arctic sledge dogs despite phenotypic differences between archaeological and modern Arctic dogs. Together, our data reveal that Inuit dogs derive from a secondary pre-contact migration of dogs distinct from Palaeo-Inuit dogs, and probably aided the Inuit expansion across the North American Arctic beginning around 1000 BP. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

This type of artefact was used to ignite the powder of firearms through a flintlock mechanism from the middle-seventeenth to the early-twentieth century in different contexts around the world. Taking what is a novel and exploratory approach in historical archaeology, this paper offers a quantitative analysis of a random sample of 200 unused gunflints recovered from the British shipwreck Deltebre I. This cargo ship belonged to an allied convoy that unsuccessfully tried to liberate Tarragona city from the Napoleonic forces, and sunk in the Ebro river delta, Catalonia, Spain, in 1813. The results from size and shape characterisation of the unused gunflints using geometric morphometric methods are presented. In order to assess morphometric variation between used and unused artefacts, this sample was compared with published images of 22 used British gunflints from different archaeological contexts. Finally, the usefulness of applied methodology to quantitatively characterise the design and morphometric variations of this kind of artefacts is highlighted. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

Studies of North African fossil microvertebrates have increased considerably in recent years, but they no longer just provide palaeontological descriptions of the species found in the assemblages. They also aim at better understanding the evolution of faunal communities in relation to Quaternary climate changes and at reconstructing the palaeoenvironmental background of prehistoric human occupations, in well-established taphonomic and chronological contexts. These studies are also increasingly adopting an integrative approach by combining archaeology, palaeontology, (palaeo)genetics, taphonomy, palaeoecology and systematics, and using new methods such as geometric morphometrics and isotopic analyses on both fossil and modern specimens. This paper aims to present a history of the studies on Quaternary terrestrial microvertebrates from northwestern Africa, and show how recent multidisciplinary studies have provided new perspectives and evidence on the respective influences of climate change and increasing human pressure on their evolution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd AUTHOR KEYWORDS: Herpetofauna; Integrative approach; Maghreb; Micromammals DOCUMENT TYPE: Article PUBLICATION STAGE: Final SOURCE: Scopus 2.1.5 (Natahi et al. 2019) Scopus EXPORT DATE:06 Apr 2020 Natahi, S., Coquerelle, M., Pereira, G., Bayle, P. 57210429853;36140239700;36192143700;35434353800; Neurocranial shape variation among Tarascan populations: Evidence for varying degrees in artificially modified crania in pre-Hispanic West Mexico (1200–1400 AD) (2019) American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 170 (3), pp. 418-432. https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070705630&amp;doi=10.1002%2fajpa.23917&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9848cacbc1a4f7470334281e873f0428 DOI: 10.1002/ajpa.23917 AFFILIATIONS: Université de Bordeaux, CNRS, MCC, UMR 5199 PACEA, Pessac, France; Department of Medicine and Surgery (Stomatology Area), Universidad Rey Juan Carlos, Alcorcón, Spain; UMR 8096, Archéologie des Amériques, CNRS, Maison René-Ginouvès, Nanterre, France ABSTRACT: Introduction: Along the Mesoamerican western margin, the Zacapu basin has yielded a large number of human remains demonstrating usage of artificial cranial modification (ACM). However, at the onset of the Middle Postclassic (1200–1400 AD) only few individuals still exhibit clear signs of ACM. Some authors have suggested that, rather than disappearing entirely, ACM may have become less visible anatomically, making it difficult to identify based on simple visual analyses. Here, we used 3D geometric morphometric methods to investigate the extent to which ACM persisted during the Postclassic in this region. Materials and methods: We measured the 3D vault’s shape changes in a sample of surface-scanned human crania: 55 individuals from the Postclassic Zacapu basin and a control group of 31 individuals from a Huichol Mexican Indian sample and a French medieval series from La Granède. We used a principal component analysis to explore the shape variation within the sample and employed the neighbor joining method to identify morphological groups. Finally, we quantified each individual’s asymmetry. Results: We identified three groups displaying shape features diverging from those of the control group. The first group is characterized by marked fronto-obelionic ACM, whereas the other two show mild forms of ACM. The individuals in all three groups display moderate to high degrees of asymmetry compared to the control group. Discussion: The marked fronto-obelionic modification is clear evidence of a specific ACM technique. The two types of mild ACM most likely result from different techniques but their moderate degree of modification brings into question the intentions behind their production. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
